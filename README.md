This application employs computer vision and gesture recognition technologies, powered by OpenCV and MediaPipe, to enable real-time hand tracking via webcam input. Users can interact with a digital canvas, drawing and manipulating content using hand gestures. The system supports dynamic features such as adjusting brush size, changing color, and erasing drawn elements. Built to operate within an integrated development environment (IDE) like VS Code, the program utilizes machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy in gesture detection, ensuring precise and responsive user interactions. Through the integration of advanced gesture recognition and computer vision techniques, the application provides an intuitive and effective platform for digital creativity.
