This application utilizes computer vision and gesture recognition technologies, powered by OpenCV and MediaPipe, to enable real-time hand tracking through webcam input. Users can interact with a digital canvas by drawing and manipulating content using intuitive hand gestures. The system offers dynamic features such as adjusting brush size, selecting colors, and erasing drawn elements. The program is designed to run within an integrated development environment (IDE) like VS Code. Through the integration of advanced gesture recognition and computer vision techniques, the application delivers accurate and responsive user interactions, providing an intuitive platform for creative digital drawing and manipulation.
