Project Overview:
This program uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to track hand movements in real-time via your webcam. It enables users to interact with a digital canvas by drawing with hand gestures. The program allows dynamic changes to the drawing, such as adjusting the brush size, color, and erasing content. This project runs in an IDE (such as VS Code) and leverages machine learning for accurate gesture recognition.

Key Features:
Real-Time Hand Tracking: Tracks hand gestures through the webcam using MediaPipe for precise hand detection.
Drawing with Hand Gestures: Users can draw freely on the canvas by using hand movements.
Brush Size and Color Adjustment: Change the brush size and color using simple hand gestures.
Erase Functionality: A gesture to erase parts of the drawing for easy corrections.
Real-Time Interaction: The program works in real-time with minimal latency, providing a smooth drawing experience.

Technologies Used:
Python: The main programming language used for development.
OpenCV: For image processing, handling webcam input, and drawing on the canvas.
MediaPipe: For real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.
Machine Learning: Utilized for hand gesture recognition and interaction.
